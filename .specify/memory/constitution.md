# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Professional Academic Structure
All project outputs, especially the textbook content, MUST adhere to a professional academic structure, suitable for university-level discourse.

### II. DocuSaurus Documentation System
DocuSaurus WILL BE the mandated documentation system for the project.

### III. GitHub Pages Deployment
The final compiled textbook MUST be deployable and accessible via GitHub Pages.

### IV. Markdown Chapter Format
All chapters and primary content for the textbook MUST be authored exclusively in Markdown format.

### V. Comprehensive Chapter Content
Every chapter MUST include a clear concept explanation, defined learning outcomes, textual descriptions of diagrams, and practical examples to reinforce understanding.

### VI. Automated Book Generation
The documentation system MUST be configured to automatically generate a homepage, comprehensive sidebar navigation, and a detailed table of contents for the textbook.

### VII. Standard DocuSaurus Output
The DocuSaurus documentation system MUST generate a `/docs` folder containing all chapters, a `sidebars.js` file for navigation configuration, and a `docusaurus.config.js` file for overall system configuration.

### VIII. Output Correctness Over Implementation Detail
The project's focus IS ON delivering correct and high-quality outputs, with implementation steps being secondary and NOT explicitly part of the generated content unless directly contributing to understanding the output.

### IX. Academic Content Style
All content MUST maintain an academic, structured, clean, and university-level writing style.

## Scope and Deliverables

This project aims to produce a comprehensive academic textbook titled "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" using the DocuSaurus documentation system. The primary deliverables include:
- A deployable textbook via GitHub Pages.
- Markdown-formatted chapters with specified content elements.
- Automatically generated navigation components (homepage, sidebar, TOC).
- Standard DocuSaurus configuration files.

## Development Workflow

The development workflow for this project will prioritize content creation and adherence to the specified principles. Content will be developed in Markdown, with a focus on academic rigor and clarity. Version control will be managed via Git, with changes reviewed to ensure compliance with the constitution. Testing will focus on the correctness of the generated documentation structure and content presentation.

## Governance

This Constitution supersedes all other project practices and guidelines. Amendments to this Constitution require a documented proposal, review, and approval by the project lead. The versioning of this Constitution will follow semantic versioning rules (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH). All contributions and development activities MUST adhere to the principles outlined herein. Compliance reviews will be conducted periodically to ensure ongoing alignment.
