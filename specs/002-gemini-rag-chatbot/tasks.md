# Tasks: AI-Powered RAG Chatbot for Book Website

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/002-gemini-rag-chatbot/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: The examples below include test tasks. Tests are OPTIONAL - only include them if explicitly requested in the feature specification.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Web app**: `backend/src/`, `frontend/src/`
- Paths shown below follow the structure from plan.md

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure

- [x] T001 Create project structure with backend and frontend directories
- [x] T002 Initialize Python project with FastAPI, Cohere SDK, Qdrant client, Google Generative AI SDK dependencies in backend/
- [x] T003 [P] Configure linting and formatting tools for Python (pylint, black, isort)
- [x] T004 [P] Initialize frontend project structure with HTML/JS/CSS files
- [x] T005 Set up environment configuration management with .env support

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [x] T006 Setup Qdrant client and connection utilities in backend/src/services/vector_store_service.py
- [x] T007 [P] Create base models: Document, Chunk, ChatSession, Message in backend/src/models/
- [x] T008 [P] Setup API routing structure with FastAPI in backend/src/api/
- [x] T009 Configure CORS middleware to allow requests from book website domain in backend/src/services/cors_service.py
- [x] T010 Create Cohere embedding service in backend/src/services/embedding_service.py
- [x] T011 Create Gemini chat service in backend/src/services/chat_service.py
- [x] T012 Setup dependency injection framework in backend/src/api/deps.py

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Interactive Book Q&A (Priority: P1) 🎯 MVP

**Goal**: Enable users to ask questions about book content through a chat interface and receive AI-generated answers based on book content

**Independent Test**: Users can enter questions in the chat interface and receive answers that reference specific content from the book. The system demonstrates value by allowing users to quickly find information within the book without manual searching.

### Tests for User Story 1 (OPTIONAL - only if tests requested) ⚠️

> **NOTE: Write these tests FIRST, ensure they FAIL before implementation**

- [ ] T013 [P] [US1] Contract test for /chat endpoint in backend/tests/contract/test_chat_endpoint.py
- [ ] T014 [P] [US1] Integration test for Q&A user journey in backend/tests/integration/test_qa_flow.py

### Implementation for User Story 1

- [x] T015 [P] [US1] Create retrieval service in backend/src/services/retrieval_service.py
- [x] T016 [US1] Create RAG retrieval tool following agent.py pattern in backend/src/tools/retrieval_tool.py
- [x] T017 [US1] Implement /chat endpoint in backend/src/api/v1/chat.py
- [x] T018 [US1] Implement basic frontend chat widget HTML structure in frontend/src/chat-widget.html
- [x] T019 [US1] Implement frontend chat widget JavaScript logic in frontend/src/chat-widget.js
- [x] T020 [US1] Implement frontend chat widget CSS styling (minimal, clean, dark-mode friendly) in frontend/src/chat-widget.css
- [x] T021 [US1] Add API communication logic to frontend widget to call /chat endpoint
- [x] T022 [US1] Add streaming response support to frontend widget for real-time display

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Story 1 should be fully functional and testable independently

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Document Upload and Indexing (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Enable administrators to upload book content or documents to be indexed and made searchable through the AI chatbot system

**Independent Test**: Admin users can upload documents and see them successfully indexed in the system, making the content available for retrieval during chat sessions.

### Tests for User Story 2 (OPTIONAL - only if tests requested) ⚠️

- [ ] T023 [P] [US2] Contract test for /embed endpoint in backend/tests/contract/test_embed_endpoint.py
- [ ] T024 [P] [US2] Contract test for /upsert endpoint in backend/tests/contract/test_upsert_endpoint.py
- [ ] T025 [P] [US2] Integration test for document indexing flow in backend/tests/integration/test_document_indexing.py

### Implementation for User Story 2

- [x] T026 [P] [US2] Implement /embed endpoint in backend/src/api/v1/embed.py
- [x] T027 [P] [US2] Implement /upsert endpoint in backend/src/api/v1/upsert.py
- [x] T028 [US2] Implement document processing logic in backend/src/services/vector_store_service.py
- [x] T029 [US2] Add chunking logic for document processing in backend/src/services/embedding_service.py
- [x] T030 [US2] Implement /search endpoint in backend/src/api/v1/search.py
- [ ] T031 [US2] Add admin interface components to frontend for document upload

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Stories 1 AND 2 should both work independently

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Integrated Chat Experience (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Ensure the chatbot interface is seamlessly integrated into the existing book website, maintaining the website's look and feel while providing enhanced interactivity

**Independent Test**: Users can access the chat functionality without leaving the book website, with consistent styling and navigation that matches the rest of the site.

### Tests for User Story 3 (OPTIONAL - only if tests requested) ⚠️

- [ ] T032 [P] [US3] Integration test for widget injection in book website in frontend/tests/test_widget_integration.js

### Implementation for User Story 3

- [x] T033 [P] [US3] Create frontend configuration model in backend/src/models/frontend_config.py
- [ ] T034 [US3] Add widget configuration options to frontend widget in frontend/src/chat-widget.js
- [ ] T035 [US3] Implement widget injection mechanism for Claude-CLI generated book

- [ ] T037 [US3] Implement widget positioning options (bottom-right, bottom-left, etc.)
- [ ] T038 [US3] Add accessibility features to chat widget

**Checkpoint**: All user stories should now be independently functional

---

## Phase 6: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Purpose**: Improvements that affect multiple user stories

- [ ] T039 [P] Documentation updates in docs/
- [ ] T040 Code cleanup and refactoring
- [ ] T041 Performance optimization across all stories
- [ ] T042 [P] Additional unit tests in backend/tests/unit/ and frontend/tests/
- [ ] T043 Security hardening for API endpoints
- [ ] T044 Run quickstart.md validation
- [ ] T045 Bundle and minify frontend assets to frontend/dist/

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3+)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 → P2 → P3)
- **Polish (Final Phase)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1 but should be independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1/US2 but should be independently testable

### Within Each User Story

- Tests (if included) MUST be written and FAIL before implementation
- Models before services
- Services before endpoints
- Core implementation before integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- All tests for a user story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Models within a story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all tests for User Story 1 together (if tests requested):
Task: "Contract test for /chat endpoint in backend/tests/contract/test_chat_endpoint.py"
Task: "Integration test for Q&A user journey in backend/tests/integration/test_qa_flow.py"

# Launch all models for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Create retrieval service in backend/src/services/retrieval_service.py"
Task: "Create RAG retrieval tool following agent.py pattern in backend/src/tools/retrieval_tool.py"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
4. Add User Story 3 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
5. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1
   - Developer B: User Story 2
   - Developer C: User Story 3
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Verify tests fail before implementing
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
