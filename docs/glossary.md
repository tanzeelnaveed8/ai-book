### **A**

-   **Action (ROS 2):** A communication type in ROS 2 used for long-running, feedback-producing tasks, like navigation. It consists of a goal, feedback, and a result.
-   **Actuator:** A component of a robot that is responsible for moving or controlling a mechanism or system, for example, a motor.

### **B**

-   **BCI (Brain-Computer Interface):** A direct communication pathway between the brain's electrical activity and an external device, such as a computer or robotic limb.

### **D**

-   **Digital Twin:** A high-fidelity virtual model of a physical object, system, or environment. In robotics, it's a simulation that is kept synchronized with its real-world counterpart.
-   **DoF (Degrees of Freedom):** The number of basic ways a rigid body can move in 3D space. Also refers to the number of independent joints in a robotic arm or leg.

### **G**

-   **Gazebo:** A popular open-source 3D robotics simulator used for physics simulation and sensor data generation.

### **I**

-   **IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit):** A sensor that measures a body's specific force, angular rate, and sometimes orientation, using a combination of accelerometers and gyroscopes.
-   **Inverse Kinematics (IK):** The mathematical process of calculating the required joint angles to place a robot's end-effector in a specific position and orientation.

### **L**

-   **LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging):** A sensor that emits laser beams and measures the time it takes for them to reflect off objects to create a 3D map of the environment (a point cloud).
-   **LLM (Large Language Model):** A deep learning model trained on vast amounts of text data, capable of understanding and generating human-like language.

### **N**

-   **Nav2:** The standard navigation stack in ROS 2, used for path planning, obstacle avoidance, and robot localization.
-   **Node (ROS 2):** The fundamental processing unit in ROS 2. An executable that performs a single, modular task.

### **R**

-   **rclpy:** The official ROS 2 client library for the Python programming language.
-   **ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2):** A flexible framework for writing robot software. It is a middleware that provides a standardized communication layer for modular software components.

### **S**

-   **SDF (Simulation Description Format):** An XML format used by simulators like Gazebo to describe everything in a simulation world, from robots to environments.
-   **SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping):** The computational problem of constructing or updating a map of an unknown environment while simultaneously keeping track of an agent's location within it.
-   **Synthetic Data Generation (SDG):** The process of using a simulator to generate large, automatically-labeled datasets for training AI models.

### **T**

-   **Topic (ROS 2):** A named bus over which ROS 2 nodes exchange messages. Topics are used for continuous data streams in a publish/subscribe pattern.

### **U**

-   **URDF (Unified Robot Description Format):** An XML format used to describe the physical model of a robot, including its links, joints, and visual appearance.

### **V**

-   **VLA (Vision-Language-Action):** An AI system architecture that connects computer vision (perception), a large language model (cognition), and robotic controllers (action).

### **Z**

-   **ZMP (Zero Moment Point):** In bipedal locomotion, the ZMP is the point on the ground where the net moment from inertial and gravitational forces is zero. Keeping the ZMP inside the support polygon of the feet is a key condition for stable walking.
