# Human-Robot Collaboration

## Introduction

This chapter focuses on the principles and practices of Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC), exploring how humans and robots can work together effectively and safely in shared workspaces. HRC aims to leverage the strengths of both human intelligence and robotic precision to achieve tasks that neither could accomplish as efficiently alone.

## Safety in HRC

Ensuring the safety of human co-workers is paramount in any collaborative robotic system.

### ISO/TS 15066

Reviewing the technical specification for collaborative robot operation, focusing on safety requirements.

### Physical Human-Robot Interaction (pHRI)

Techniques and strategies for enabling safe physical contact and force interaction between humans and robots.

## Levels of Collaboration

Defining the different degrees to which humans and robots can interact and cooperate.

### Coexistence

Humans and robots operate in the same workspace but without direct interaction.

### Synchronized Collaboration

Humans and robots perform tasks sequentially or in a coordinated manner without direct contact.

### Cooperative Collaboration

Humans and robots share the same workspace and task, interacting directly and simultaneously.

## Human-Robot Interface

Designing intuitive and effective interfaces for human operators to interact with collaborative robots.

### Gesture and Voice Control

Using natural human communication methods to command and guide robots.

### Augmented Reality in HRC

Leveraging AR to provide visual feedback and task guidance to human operators.
