# Advanced Bipedal Locomotion

## Introduction

This chapter explores advanced concepts and techniques in bipedal locomotion for humanoid robots. It delves into the complexities of dynamic balancing, gait generation, and robust control strategies required for stable and efficient walking, running, and navigating challenging terrains.

## Dynamic Walking and Balancing

Understanding and implementing dynamic walking is crucial for bipedal robots to move beyond static stability.

### Zero Moment Point (ZMP) Control

The Zero Moment Point (ZMP) criterion is a fundamental concept for analyzing and controlling the dynamic stability of bipedal robots.

### Centroidal Momentum Control

Centroidal Momentum Control (CMC) offers a more generalized framework for whole-body dynamic control, considering the robot's overall momentum.

## Gait Generation

Designing effective gait patterns is essential for diverse locomotion capabilities.

### Pattern Generators

Biological inspiration for rhythmic movements often leads to central pattern generators (CPGs) in robotic gait design.

### Optimization-Based Gait Planning

Using optimization techniques to generate energy-efficient and stable gait trajectories.

## Terrain Adaptation

Enabling bipedal robots to traverse uneven and unpredictable surfaces.

### Footstep Planning

Algorithms for intelligently selecting optimal footholds in complex environments.

### Hybrid Control Architectures

Combining different control strategies to handle various phases of locomotion, from flat ground walking to stair climbing.
